      <br><h1>Canvas Demo</h1>
      
      <h2>About Canvas</h2>
      <p>Canvas was initially introduced by Apple in 2004 to power various features in it's MAC OS and Safari browser. It slowly gained popularity and today is featured in all mainstream web browsers and in HTML5. Currently Canvas is an element used in HTML5 to create images, animations, and games.</p>
      <p>Canvas is used by creating a canvas tag in your HTML document. It then utilizes JS functions to render the image. Canvas uses detailed pixels to render the image so it is very good at rendering graphics and games. The other alternative is SVG which is line based. SVG is better at rendering more simple designs that use mostly lines (i.e. text, shapes, etc.), and is much easier to program, on the downside it is not fit for complex graphics or games because it renders much slower than canvas.</p><br>
